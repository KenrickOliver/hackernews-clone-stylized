A styleized clone of the hackernews website ([original site](https://news.ycombinator.com/)).<br />
A Live Demo of the app can be found here: [Live Site](https://kenrickoliver.github.io/hackernews-clone-stylized/).

Some of the Apps main features include: 
- App designed and built as an SPA(Single Page Application) so the entire app does not refresh on route/page change.
- Consuming data from 3rd party HackerNews API to fetch blog posts, while hitting multiple endpoints(/newest, /show, /jobs etc...)
- uses a 3rd party npm package(navego) for Routing to manage routes for the various endpoints being returned by the API as well as a few custom routes. 
- Some other functionality includes pagination, posts limiting and ability to save blog posts to favorites.
